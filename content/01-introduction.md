## Introduction to Machine Learning

Let's suppose a person wants to sell a car. Depending on some characteristics of the cars, such as its make, model,
mileage, year, etc...they can sell it for a certain price.
Hence, an expert can look at the cars _features_ and determine a price based on them. The expert is able to accomplish
this by looking at the data and extracting patterns from it (say, fewer mileage, recent years might increase the
car's value). This is exactly what machine learning does.

**Machine Learning** is a technique used to build models which can extract patterns from data.

- **Features** are characteristics of the data we have that we can use to predict other variables.
- **Target** is the response variable that we want to predict and understand in a more meaningful way.
- **Model** is a set of statistical / rule-based patterns that predicts a variable given some features.
