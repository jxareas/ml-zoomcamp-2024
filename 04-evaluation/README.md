# Evaluation Metrics for Classification

[![Python][python_logo]][homework]

This chapter focuses on **Evaluation Metrics** for classification models, which are crucial to understanding the
performance of your model and how well it predicts outcomes. You'll explore essential metrics like accuracy, precision,
recall, ROC AUC, and k-fold cross-validation.

The topics covered in this chapter include:

* **Accuracy and Dummy Model**: Evaluating the performance of your model with a basic accuracy check and comparing it
  with a dummy model.
* **Confusion Matrix**: Understanding how well your model is classifying data with true positives, false positives, true
  negatives, and false negatives.
* **Precision and Recall**: Evaluating your modelâ€™s ability to correctly identify positive instances, and minimizing
  false positives and false negatives.
* **ROC AUC**: Analyzing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to assess
  model performance.
* **K-Fold Cross Validation**: Using cross-validation to ensure that your model generalizes well on unseen data.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be equipped to evaluate your machine learning model effectively and understand the
trade-offs between different metrics.
