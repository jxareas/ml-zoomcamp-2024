# Tree-Based Models

[![Python][python_logo]][homework]

This chapter dives into **Decision Trees** and **Ensemble Learning** techniques, exploring methods that can
significantly improve model performance and robustness. You’ll learn how to create, tune, and evaluate these models
effectively.

The topics covered in this chapter include:

* **Decision Trees**: Learn the fundamentals of decision trees, including tree building, feature selection, and
  parameter tuning to enhance model accuracy.
* **Ensemble Learning with Random Forest**: Explore **Random Forest**, a powerful ensemble technique, understanding how
  multiple trees work together to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
* **Gradient Boosting and XGBoost**: Introduction to **Gradient Boosting** and **XGBoost**, covering the principles of
  boosting and how to fine-tune these models for optimal performance.
* **Model Selection**: Discover best practices for selecting and evaluating models, comparing ensemble methods against
  simpler models to make the best choice for your task.

By the end of this module, you’ll have the skills to leverage decision trees and ensemble methods for complex tasks,
enhancing accuracy and robustness.
