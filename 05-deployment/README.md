# Model Deployment

[![Python][python_logo]][homework]

This chapter focuses on **model deployment** and **environment management**, guiding you through key practices to save,
serve, and deploy machine learning models effectively. You'll learn to build a web service for your model and handle
dependencies efficiently, preparing it for production.

The topics covered in this chapter include:

* **Saving and Loading Models**: Learn to save and load machine learning models using **pickle**, and convert Jupyter
  notebooks into standalone Python scripts.
* **Web Services**: Introduction to **Flask** for building web services. You'll start by creating a simple app
  and later wrap your prediction model into a Flask API, preparing it for production using **gunicorn** and **waitress
  **.
* **Python Virtual Environments with Pipenv**: Understand the importance of virtual environments and manage dependencies
  effectively using **Pipenv**.
* **Environment Management**: Learn how to containerize your application using **Docker**, including writing
  a Dockerfile and building/running Docker images.
* **Cloud Deployment**: Optionally, deploy your model to the cloud using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, learning to use the
  Elastic Beanstalk CLI for deployment and management.

By the end of this module, you'll be equipped to deploy your machine learning model efficiently, from local environments
to production-ready services in the cloud.
