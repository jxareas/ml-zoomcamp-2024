# Machine Learning for Classification

[![Python][python_logo]][homework]

This chapter delves into the theme of **Classification in Machine Learning**, where the goal is to predict categorical outcomes. We'll work through various methods to analyze, prepare, and model data for classification tasks, with a focus on churn prediction.

The topics covered in this chapter include:

* **Churn Prediction Project**: Understanding the problem and the data.
* **Feature Importance - Churn Rate and Risk Ratio**: Analyzing key features affecting churn.
* **Feature Importance - Mutual Information**: Identifying valuable features through statistical measures.
* **Feature Importance - Correlation**: Evaluating how features relate to each other.
* **One-Hot Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical format.
* **Logistic Regression**: Introduction to the algorithm and its mechanics.
* **Model Interpretation**: Understanding the outputs and coefficients of the model.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have hands-on experience in preparing data, training classification models, and interpreting their results, specifically within the context of churn prediction.
